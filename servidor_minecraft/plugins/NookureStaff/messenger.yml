# The configuration for the Redis messenger.
redis:
  # The address of the Redis server.
  # This should be in the format of `host`.
  # For example, `localhost`.
  address: localhost

  # The port of the Redis server.
  # This should be a number between 1 and 65535.
  port: 6379

  # The username to use when connecting to the Redis server.
  # If the server does not require a username, leave this empty.
  username: ''

  # The password to use when connecting to the Redis server.
  # If the server does not require a password, leave this empty.
  password: ''

  # The database to use when connecting to the Redis server.
  # This should be a number between 0 and 15.
  database: 0

  # The pool size to use when connecting to the Redis server.
  pool-size: 10

  # The timeout to use when connecting to the Redis server.
  timeout: 2000

# This UUID represents the server in SQL databases, ensure it's unique.
server-id: e07d23e8-4537-43fe-bbed-49dcf7183731

# The type of messenger to use.
# Here are the options:
# - REDIS: Use Redis to send messages between servers, the most
#   reliable way to send messages between servers, but it requires
#   a Redis server to be installed and configured, it's the fastest.

# - PM: Use plugin messages to send messages between servers this
#   will only work if all the servers are under the same proxy and
#   in the proxy is installed the bridge plugin, it's not the most
#   reliable way to send messages between servers.

# - MYSQL: Use MySQL to send messages between servers, a bit more
#   reliable than PM but much more slower than Redis.

# - NONE: Disable the sync, useful when you don't have a network
# and you only have 1 server.
type: NONE
